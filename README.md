1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial, a consulting company specializing in personalized financial planning, was my client for this project. They sought to modernize their operations by enhancing the security of their RESTful web application, focusing on protecting sensitive financial data from external threats.

2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

In identifying software security vulnerabilities for Artemis Financial, I excelled at interpreting the client's needs and understanding the critical nature of secure communications for handling confidential client information. Coding securely is paramount as it prevents unauthorized access, data breaches, and maintains client trust, which is vital for a company's reputation and legal compliance. Secure software adds immense value by reducing the risk of financial loss, legal issues, and loss of customer confidence, thereby contributing to the overall well-being and sustainability of the company.

3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was manually reviewing the code for potential security flaws, as it required a deep understanding of security principles and meticulous attention to detail. However, this process was also very helpful as it honed my ability to think like an attacker, which is crucial for a comprehensive security analysis.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase layers of security, I recommended implementing input validation, using secure API design practices, and incorporating cryptography for data protection. Moving forward, I would employ automated tools like static code analyzers (ex. SonarQube) alongside manual reviews to assess vulnerabilities. For mitigation, I would use established frameworks like OWASP's guidelines to decide on techniques, ensuring a structured approach to security enhancements.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure the code and software application were both functional and secure, I followed best practices in coding and security design. After refactoring, I would use a combination of automated testing tools, like unit tests for functionality, and security scanners to check for newly introduced vulnerabilities, ensuring that the security posture was not compromised.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

During this project, I utilized resources like OWASP's security guidelines, Java security best practices, and tools like GitHub for version control. These practices and tools are invaluable for future assignments, providing a foundation for secure coding and collaborative development.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
   
For future employers, I would showcase the Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report as it demonstrates my ability to conduct thorough security assessments, identify vulnerabilities, and propose actionable mitigation strategies. This artifact highlights my skills in software security, critical thinking, and problem-solving, which are essential for any role in software development or cybersecurity.
